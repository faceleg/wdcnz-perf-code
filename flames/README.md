# Challenge â€” flames

In this challenge you'll find program that simulates CPU usage in different
operations. The simulation is paremeterized with the amount of spin time
they will waste.

## Generating flamegraphs

You need to be using Linux, either on your laptop, a virtual machine or a VPS.

Make sure perf is installed.

Run your node program with:
`node --perf_basic_prof myprogram.js`

Run perf to trace the node process for 10 seconds:
`sudo perf record -q -F 999 -p $(pgrep node) -g -- sleep 10`

Make sure the generated map file is owned by the same user that runs perf:
`sudo chown root /tmp/perf-*.map`

Output the recorded activity into a file:
`sudo perf script > /tmp/script`

Use stackvis to generate a flame-graph from the perf script.
`stackvis perf < /tmp/script > /tmp/flamegraph.html`

Open flamegraph.html in your browser.

## Interpreting flamegraphs

A flamegraph shows collapsed stack traces collected from the target program.

The horizontal axis has no meaning.

Every ocurrence of a function in a stack trace is represented by a rectangle.
If the stacktrace up to that function is the same as in another collected
stacktrace then they are collapsed and the rectangle becomes wider.

This means that the wider the rectange, the more frequent was the function
seen in the underlying stacktrace.

## Experiment

Try changing the parameters passed to `spin(milliseconds)`, re-generate a
flamegraph and compare with the previous one.
