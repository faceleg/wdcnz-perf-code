**NOTE:** You should complete the [calc-server](../calc-server) challenge before this one. This is an extra bonus exercise, which illustrates a similar type of resource leak in a real-world application.

Ghost is a popular Node.js-based blogging engine. Growing memory usage was being reported by users
shortly after v0.5.3 was released.

Your task is to investigate the memory leak using Minigun and heapdump.
